  <p> Made by Kyle dela victoria. My parents are Jennifer dela Victoria and Apollo dela Victoria.<br>
  Born in January 5, 1999, in adventist hospital. I had interest in music and art but it's not <br>
as much as back then. I used to be in a choir in my church back then suprise suprise.<br>You will most likely
find me in a computershop or at home. I rarely like people but once I do. I will be one of your close friends. <br>
 Nickname is tata and i'm a 21 year old IT student from Philippines.<br> My dream is to be successful one day and have
 all the money that i'll need to make my parents proud. <br> After college, there's a chance to go to canada since many of my relatives are there.<br>
 Maybe this will make my dream in a reality.<br> 
  
  my hobbies are playing computer, eating foods and biking. <br> Hi and welcome to my github page and I hope 
  you find it pleasing being here.
